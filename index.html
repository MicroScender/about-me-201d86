    <h1>About Me</h1>
  </header>
   <p> Hello there.
      My name is Joseph Sellars and writing about myself is one of my least favorite things to do, just above eating kitty litter covered cat feces. 
      I was born 08/27/1988 in Fort Myers, Florida. Evangelical Christian School had the pleasure of graduating me from highschool. 
     By the time I graduated highschool, my academic prowess was most excellent as I was ranked 51st of 52 students.</p> 
    <p>Three months after graduation I went off to Great Lakes Naval Base for navy bootcamp. 
      After getting kicked out of Cryptologic Technician A school in Pensacola, Florida for drinking underage, I went to the west coast fleet with an undesignated job classification.
      Three years of my naval career were spent aboard the USS Bunker Hill where I cross-rated over to Aviation Mechanic. 
      Before changing jobs I had the opportunity to experience some pretty cool side-jobs like master helmsman and rhib-coxswain. 
      09/10/2010 marked the end to my four year involvement with the USN.</p> 
      <p>I hear that as a new software engineer I should learn to love failure.<br>
        This seems to be a part of my persona already as I successfully failed to complete each degree that I was pursuing. <br>
        Short term goals include successfully finishing this lab on time and successfully finishing Code Fellows in   it's software engineering course entirety.   
        Long term, I would love to create symbiosis between an AGI and human consciousness into one cyborg being.
      </p>
